## Development Status
- ðŸ”„ **In Progress**: Basic structure and routing
- ðŸ“‹ **Next**: Admin authentication and dashboard
- ðŸ“‹ **Future**: Enum management interfaces
- ðŸ“‹ **Future**: Registration approval workflows

## Security Considerations
- **Separate domain**: console.procureserve.com
- **Admin-only access**: Role-based authentication
- **Audit logging**: All actions logged with user attribution
- **Rate limiting**: API protection for admin operations
- **Secure headers**: Enhanced security for admin interface

This console app will be developed in parallel with the main customer app features.
