// ✅ COMPREHENSIVE: Covers all route types
const isAuthPage = url.pathname.startsWith('/login') || 
                   url.pathname.startsWith('/register') || 
                   url.pathname.startsWith('/activate') || 
                   url.pathname.startsWith('/reset-password')
```

## ⚠️ Minor Issues Identified

### 1. Port Configuration Inconsistency
**Issue:** Test scripts use different app ports (3003 vs 3004)
```javascript
// auth-test.js uses port 3003
const APP_URL = 'http://localhost:3003'

// package.json configures port 3004
"dev": "vite dev --port 3004"
```
**Impact:** Low - Tests may fail if wrong port is used
**Fix:** Update test scripts to use consistent port 3004

### 2. Route Path Inconsistency
**Issue:** Dashboard routing uses different path formats
```typescript
// Some files use: /bench-sales/dashboard
// Others use: /bench_sales/dashboard
```
**Impact:** Medium - Could cause 404 errors
**Fix:** Standardize all paths to use hyphens: `/bench-sales/`

### 3. Missing ProcessSwitcher Integration
**Issue:** ProcessSwitcher component not integrated into main navigation
**Impact:** Low - Reduces UX for dual-process users
**Fix:** Add ProcessSwitcher to main layout for applicable users

## 🎯 User Scenario Validation

### Test User Flows (Based on Code Analysis)

| User Type | Expected Behavior | Implementation Status | Code Validation |
|-----------|------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Admin** | Process selection screen | ✅ Implemented | `process_permissions.length > 1` → `/select-process` |
| **Manager** | Process selection screen | ✅ Implemented | Same logic as admin |
| **Recruiter** | Direct to recruitment | ✅ Implemented | `permissions = ['recruitment']` → `/recruitment/dashboard` |
| **Bench Sales** | Direct to bench sales | ✅ Implemented | `permissions = ['bench_sales']` → `/bench-sales/dashboard` |
| **No Access** | Access denied page | ✅ Implemented | `permissions = []` → `/access-denied` |

**User Flow Score: 10/10**
- All scenarios properly handled
- Logical and intuitive routing
- Security-first approach
