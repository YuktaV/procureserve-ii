## üöÄ Phase 7 Development Priority Plan

Based on your priorities, here's the recommended sequence:

### **Phase 7A: User Edit Interface** (High Priority - Week 1)
**Objective:** Complete user management CRUD operations

**Components to Build:**
- User edit modal/page (`/settings/users/[id]/edit`)
- Role modification interface
- Permission management controls
- User activation/deactivation
- Password reset functionality

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 components (<50 lines each)
**Database:** Uses existing schema, no migrations needed

### **Phase 7B: Business Units & Departments** (High Priority - Week 2)
**Objective:** Organizational hierarchy management

**Components to Build:**
- Business unit management interface
- Department creation and assignment
- User-to-unit assignment
- Hierarchical organization views
- Manager assignment controls

**Estimated Effort:** 4-5 components
**Database:** `business_units` table already exists from Phase 5

### **Phase 7C: Audit Trail Dashboard** (Medium Priority - Week 3)
**Objective:** Security monitoring and compliance

**Components to Build:**
- Admin action history
- User activity monitoring
- Security event tracking
- Compliance reporting
- Export capabilities

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 components
